# FairMLAudits

The most comprehensive professionally curated resource on Fairness Auditing of ML models including the best tutorials, videos, books, papers, articles, courses, websites, conferences and open-source libraries code in Python.

I have created this resource while completing my PhD in Fair Machine Learning with the NoBias ITN Network. The resources were meticulously collected since 2020 and after completing my PhD. I have decided to share them with the global machine learning community.
